<p>The Internet of Things, as a concept, wasnâ€™t officially named until 1999. One of the first examples of an Internet of Things is from the 
early 1980s, and was a Coca Cola machine, located at the Carnegie Melon University. Local programmers would connect by Internet to the 
refrigerated appliance, and check to see if there was a drink available, and if it was cold, before making the trip.</p>

<p>By the year 2013, the Internet of Things had evolved into to a system using multiple technologies, ranging from the Internet to wireless 
communication and from micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to embedded systems. The traditional fields of automation (including the automation 
of buildings and homes), wireless sensor networks, GPS, control systems, and others, all support the IoT.</p>
